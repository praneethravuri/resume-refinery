### INPUTS

- A **Full Resume** (Markdown) that includes:  
  - Header  
  - Work Experience sections (each with all bullets from Step 4)  
  - Projects (all bullets)  
  - Skills (complete)  
  - Education (complete)

### OBJECTIVES

1. **SCAN EACH BULLET** for:  
   - Adverbs/adjectives that do not add technical value (e.g., “quickly,” “successfully,” “creative”).  
   - Filler phrases (e.g., “in order to,” “as needed,” “responsible for,” “involved in”).  
   - Corporate buzzwords (“synergy,” “utilized,” “dynamic,” “leveraged,” “innovative”).  
   - Personal pronouns (“I,” “we,” “my,” “our”).  
   - Subjective/abstract descriptors (“a wide variety,” “many,” “large number”).  
2. **IF A BULLET CONTAINS ANY** of the above, **REWRITE** it to:  
   - Maintain the **same metric**, **same keywords/technologies**, and **same domain context**.  
   - Be as concise as possible—remove all extraneous phrasing.  
   - Keep length at **15–18 words max**.  
   - Begin with a **strong action verb**.  
3. **IF A BULLET HAS NO FILLER**, simply copy it exactly.

4. **SKILLS SECTION**  
   - Copy it verbatim (since skills themselves have no filler).  
   - Do not change any entries.

5. **OTHER SECTIONS (Education, Header, etc.)**  
   - Copy them verbatim.

### OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

- Produce a **single Markdown document** that includes:  
  - Header (unchanged)  
  - Work Experience (all bullets—rewritten where needed + unchanged)  
  - Projects (all bullets—rewritten where needed + unchanged)  
  - Skills (unchanged)  
  - Education (unchanged)

- Use `- ` to denote each bullet in its section.  
- Preserve each company/project heading exactly as in the input.

### CHAIN OF THOUGHT

1. **SCAN** every bullet for fillers or buzzwords.  
2. **IDENTIFY**: If a bullet is already perfectly concise (15–18 words, no filler), do not touch it.  
3. **REWRITE**:  
   - Remove unnecessary adjectives/adverbs/filler phrases/buzzwords/personal pronouns.  
   - Preserve the metric, keywords, and technologies exactly.  
   - Maintain 15–18 words, start with a strong verb.  
4. **COPY** bullets that require no changes.  
5. **ASSEMBLE** the final resume:  
   - All Work Experience bullets (rewritten + unchanged).  
   - All Project bullets (rewritten + unchanged).  
   - Skills (unchanged).  
   - Education (unchanged).

### WHAT NOT TO DO

- **DO NOT DROP** any bullets—even if they contain filler, they must be rewritten rather than removed.  
- **DO NOT ALTER** Skills, Education, Header, or Section Headings.  
- **NEVER ADD** new metrics or keywords—only remove filler language.  
- **NEVER EXCEED** 18 words per bullet or go under 15 words.  

When finished, output the entire resume (with all bullets and sections) in Markdown format, filler-free.
