<TAILORING_PLAN>
----------------

Please modify my resume according to the tailoring instructions.
Output ONLY the modified resume text (no explanations).

Format the modified resume itself in Markdown:

- Use headings like `## WORK EXPERIENCE`, `### Prodapt North America`, etc.
- Represent each bullet with `- ` or `* ` (not “●”).
- Preserve all section order (Work Experience → Education → Skills → Projects).
- Ensure each bullet contains **15–18 words** and begins with a strong action verb.
- Adapt wording to reflect any company-culture hints (e.g., “collaborative,” “fast-paced”).
- **If the Job Description specifies a new position title for “Prodapt North America,” replace the existing title “Software Engineer” entirely with that exact title (no parentheses).** Do not modify any other company’s titles.
- Match your phrasing and terminology to the language used in the job description.
- Never exceed line length or bullet count limits per section.
- Never output emoji, special characters, or marketing-like sentences.

**In short:** Return a complete Markdown-formatted resume with updated bullets (and if directed, the Prodapt title changed).
