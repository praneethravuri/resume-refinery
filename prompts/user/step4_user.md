<TAILORED_RESUME>
--------------------------

The above is my Step‐3 output. Please update only the “Skills” section
in the same Markdown format. That is:
- If the resume uses `## SKILLS` as a heading, keep it there.
- List each category under “Skills” as a bullet (e.g. `- Programming Languages:`).
- Do not remove any existing skill; only add missing ones.
- Preserve the rest of the resume exactly as Markdown.

Output the full, updated resume again in Markdown.
